        <p>HOCOYON is a youth organization that blend between leadership and learning as both are indispensable to each other. Our voice in the community is one factor and the practical solutions is another. I therefore yearn to inspire the homabay county youths to dream more,learn more,do more and become more.It is my call on them and invite the world at large to help shape them not to follow where the path may lead but to where there is no path and to leave a trail through innovation which distinguishes between this generation and that to come as a leader and as a champion but not a follower. At HOCOYON, we come together to give youths a chance since "nothing is for us without us!"</p>

          I believe in youths as the energy and force needed to drive this great nation. The time has come where the old eras have been revolutionalized into an era where the youth and women are held with utmost faith to push the economy further.At HOCOYON we realize and give the youths the push they require to achieve this

          What does it mean to be rooted in a community? To be rooted in a community is to be grounded, with deep connections to people and places. It means being part of an ecosystem in which diverse, generous and committed people work together to solve challenges. It means nourishing connections between business, non-profit organizations, individuals and families to strengthen a Community for change. Systematic and enduring change is possible when a community is able to initiate and drive their own development and other actors to access basic needs and services as well as harness and grow their own resources. Youths being undisputable Community, it only takes a SMART work to achieve the change."When you're succesful, thre's a temptation to believe you did it all yourself, when in reality thousands of people touch our lives along. I believe we all have the power and the responsiblity to create these moments for ourselves and the next generation inorder to shoot for the moon" Homabay County Youth Network believe in, and advocates for a cohessive approach in driving sustainable Community change. Borrowing from Benard Shaw,"I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the community and as long as i live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever i can. I want to be throughly used up when i die, for the harder I work, the more i live." It is my honest belief that when the we committedly come together in the same spirit, we can be sure of a sustainable change. I am, because we are!
