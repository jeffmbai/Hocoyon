  	   	   	   	  <p>We all dream but not equally, those of us who dream by the night in the dusty recesses of their minds wake up in the morning to shocker of vanity. At Hoyocon, we endeavour to dream by the day with our eyes open to ensure our dreams come through, takes us further and faster in the realms of life transformation within our society</p>

                <p>"Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor;it must be demanded by the oppressed"-Martin Luther King Jr. I believe the youth can come up and fight for the spaces to be inclusive and accomodate their various needs, interests, activities and can contribute to combating prejudice, division and harassement. I take active involvement in these chances for the youth through engaging in/founding youth-led agricultural development programs and projects to achieve self reliace among the youth</p>

                We must purpose to live a life full of vigour and let others realise our space in life. As youths of Homa Bay County Youth Network we purpose to let another generation of young people coming after us to find a trace of what we did years later and so we wish to act in solidarity
